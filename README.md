Simple project starter for standard python apps. 

This should work for any python project (framework agnostic). Although it may require aditional configurations to be effective with frameworks.

* Type Checking with MyPy
* import sort with isort
* pytest for unit testing and test coverage report (current threshold at 80%)
* pipenv to manage environment
* Hooks for commit.

### Planned

* Run linting tasks on editor save.
* Better folder structure
